# Pipex
 Pipex is a 42 project that recreates the behavior of the shell's pipe (|). It redirects the output of one program as the input to another, simulating inter-process communication. This project focuses on file descriptors, processes, and system calls, deepening your understanding of how the Unix shell works internally.
